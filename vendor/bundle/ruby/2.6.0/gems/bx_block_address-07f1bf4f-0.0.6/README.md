# BxBlockAddress

Short description and motivation.

## Usage

How to use my plugin.

Note if you set latitude and longitude is will override whatever is in address.

Also, address is polymorphic but this block only creates addresses for `AccountBlock::Account` so any other endity, say
businesses, will need a new block creating for it.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'bx_block_address'
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
$ gem install bx_block_address
```
